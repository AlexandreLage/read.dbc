## Introduction

`read.dbc` is a R package to enable importing data from `DBC` files. DBC is the extension for compressed DBF files (from the 'XBASE' family of databases).

While it's not a very common format, the DBC file has extensive usage by the Brazilian government to publish Public Health data.

DATASUS is the name of the Department of Informatics of Brazilian Health System and is resposible for publishing those data. The Brazilian National Agency for Supplementary Health (ANS) also uses the DBC format for its public data.

This code was tested using files from both DATASUS and ANS to ensure compliance with the format, and hence ensure its usability by researchers.

It is based on the work of [Mark Adler](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/blast) (blast) and [Pablo Fonseca](https://github.com/eaglebh/blast-dbf) (blast-dbf).

## Installation

The easiest way to install this package is using the `devtools` library:

        devtools::install_github("danicat/read.dbc")
        
## Usage

Reading a DBC file to a data frame:

	# The 'sids.dbc' file is the compressed version of 'sids.dbf' from the "foreign" package.
	x <- read.dbc(system.file("files/sids.dbc", package="read.dbc"))
	str(x)
	summary(x)

	# This is a small subset of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database.
	storm <- read.dbc(system.file("files/storm.dbc", package="read.dbc"))
	head(x)
	str(x)

	## Note: Don't run!
	## The following code downloads a file from the Brazilian's National Agency for Supplementary Health (ANS/DATASUS)
	download.file("http://ans.gov.br/images/stories/Materiais_para_pesquisa/Perfil_setor/Dados_e_indicadores_do_setor/ans_tabnet/dados_dbc/operadoras/oper_com_registro_ativo/tb_opa_1603.dbc", destfile = "tb_opa_1603.dbc")
	opa <- read.dbc("tb_opa_1603.dbc")
	head(opa, n=2)

Decompressing a DBC file to a DBF:

	# The call return logi = TRUE on success
	if( dbc2dbf("files/sids.dbc","files/sids.dbf") ) {
	     print("File decompressed!")
	}
